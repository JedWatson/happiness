[Standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) customised to make [us](#maintainers) happy.

This is a fork of Standard with two changes:

- **Tabs** for indentions
- **Semicolons** always

It is called happiness, because we hope that it brings you joy, love and ends strife among your fellow developers.

**Reminder**: Happiness is not for everyone.  Some people will choose to be sad, normal and some might even say "standard".
That is alright.  A happy person is comfortable with being them and fine to let others be who they want to be.  *"You do you"*

If the information you are looking for is not in this readme, you should take a look at the [Standard readme](https://github.com/feross/standard), it might have what you are looking for.

## Install

```bash
$ npm install happiness
```

## Usage

The easiest way to use JavaScript Happiness Style to check your code is to install it
globally as a Node command line program. To do so, simply run the following command in
your terminal (flag `-g` installs `happiness` globally on your system, omit it if you want
to install in the current working directory):

```bash
$ npm install happiness -g
```

After you've done that you should be able to use the `happiness` program. The simplest use
case would be checking the style of all JavaScript files in the current working directory:

```bash
$ happiness
Error: Use JavaScript happiness Style
  lib/torrent.js:950:11: Expected '===' and instead saw '=='.
```

You can optionally pass in a directory (or directories) using the glob pattern. Be sure to quote paths containing glob patterns so that they are expanded by standard instead of your shell:

```bash
$ happiness "src/util/**/*.js" "test/**/*.js"
```

Many people like to add happiness to their testing setup. To do this, save the packge as a dev dependency and add happiness to your package.json's test script:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev happiness
```

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "happiness && mocha # <- or whatever test runner you use"
  }
}
```

**Note:** by default `happiness` will look for all files matching the patterns: `**/*.js`, `**/*.jsx`.
